To solve the hidden node problem, the protocol uses a handshake mechanism: RTS (Request to Send): The sending station transmits an RTS frame to the AP to request channel access. CTS (Clear to Send): The AP responds with a CTS frame. Since the AP is centrally located, this signal reaches all stations in the BSS, effectively informing even the hidden nodes that they must remain silent during the upcoming transmission."
